# Code format styles
# 1. Indentation should be 2 spaces
# 2. Put : then and ; do on same line as while, for and if
# 3. Prefer ${var} over $var
# 4. For string, uoting with '' means no variable substitution required. Quoting with "" means variable substitution required.
# 5. To check if string is null or not, use -z and -n flags instead of checking for null or 0 length
# 6. Naming Convention for functions : use lower case with _ seperating words. function keyword is optional. Paranthesis are required after function name.
# 7. Naming conventions for variables : lower case letters
# 8. Environment variables and Constants : At top of file and in Caps seperated by _
# 9. Constants should have "readonly" "declare -r" at where constant variable is defined
#10. Local variables : when declaring local variables inside a function fir usage, use local keyword at start. Eg: local var=${1}
#11. These is no "main" function in bash script. So, Implement this function at end of script and call explicitly in case of a longer script.
